# AI Agents

This document provides guidance for AI agent interactions with this project.

## Overview

This project uses AI assistance for development tasks including code generation, refactoring, documentation, and optimization.

## Getting Started (For New Sessions)

**IMPORTANT:** When starting a new Copilot session, you MUST read the following files first:

1. **Read [.ai/instructions.md](.ai/instructions.md)** - Contains project-specific coding conventions, guidelines, and AI interaction patterns
2. **Review [.ai/contributions.md](.ai/contributions.md)** - Historical context of AI contributions and lessons learned

These documents are essential for maintaining consistency with project standards and understanding the codebase architecture.

## Documentation

|------|---------|
| [.ai/instructions.md](.ai/instructions.md) | AI guidelines and coding conventions (auto-loaded by Copilot) |
