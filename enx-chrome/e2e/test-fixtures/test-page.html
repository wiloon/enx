        <h2>Understanding Software Development</h2>

        <p>
            Software development is a complex process that requires careful planning
            and execution. Developers must consider various factors including
            performance, scalability, and maintainability when building applications.
        </p>

        <p>
            Modern frameworks provide powerful tools for creating robust applications.
            Technologies like React, Vue, and Angular have revolutionized frontend
            development, making it easier to build interactive user interfaces.
        </p>

        <p>
            Testing is an essential component of software quality assurance.
            Unit tests verify individual components, while integration tests
            ensure different modules work together correctly. End-to-end testing
            validates the entire application workflow from start to finish.
        </p>

        <p>
            Continuous integration and deployment practices help teams deliver
            software faster and more reliably. Automated pipelines build, test,
            and deploy code changes, reducing manual errors and improving efficiency.
        </p>

        <p>
            Cloud computing has transformed how we deploy and scale applications.
            Services like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud provide infrastructure
            that can automatically adjust to changing demand, ensuring applications
            remain available and performant.
