    <h1>TypeScript Programming Language</h1>

    <div class="content">
        <p>
            TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript,
            giving you better tooling at any scale. It was developed and is maintained by
            Microsoft, first released in October 2012.
        </p>

        <p>
            The language extends JavaScript by adding static type definitions. Types provide
            a way to describe the shape of an object, providing better documentation and
            allowing TypeScript to validate that your code is working correctly.
        </p>

        <p>
            TypeScript code is transformed into JavaScript code via the TypeScript compiler
            or Babel. This JavaScript is clean, simple code which runs anywhere JavaScript
            runs: in a browser, on Node.js, or in your applications.
        </p>

        <p>
            Major frameworks and libraries have adopted TypeScript. Angular is built with
            TypeScript, Vue 3 is written in TypeScript, and React has excellent TypeScript
            support with comprehensive type definitions.
        </p>

        <p>
            The adoption of TypeScript has grown significantly in recent years. Many
            developers appreciate the enhanced productivity and code quality that static
            typing brings to large-scale JavaScript applications.
